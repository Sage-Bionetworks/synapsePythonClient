# GitHub Action workflow for testing, building, and releasing the Synapse Python Client.

# - all pushes, releases, and pull requests  are tested against unit tests, and additionally
#     integration tests if account configuration secrets are available.
# - releases are additionally packaged, uploaded as build and release artifacts,
#     and deployed to pypi servers (test.pypi.org for prereleases, and pypi.org for releases)
#     Release tags must conform to our semver versioning, e.g. v1.2.3 in order to be packaged
#     for pypi deployment.
