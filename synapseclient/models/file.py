    Attributes:
        id: The unique immutable ID for this file. A new ID will be generated for new
            Files. Once issued, this ID is guaranteed to never change or be re-issued.
        name: The name of this entity. Must be 256 characters or less. Names may only

        description: The description of this file. Must be 1000 characters or less.
        parent_id: The ID of the Entity that is the parent of this Entity. Setting this
            to a new value and storing it will move this File under the new parent.
        version_label: The version label for this entity. Updates to the entity will
            increment the version number.
        version_comment: The version comment for this entity
        data_file_handle_id: ID of the file associated with this entity. You may define
            an existing data_file_handle_id to use the existing data_file_handle_id. The
            creator of the file must also be the owner of the data_file_handle_id to
            have permission to store the file.
        external_url: The external URL of this file. If this is set AND `synapse_store`
            is False, only a reference to this URL and the file metadata will be stored
            in Synapse. The file itself will not be uploaded. If this attribute is set
            it will override the `path`.
        activity: The Activity model represents the main record of Provenance in
            Synapse. It is analygous to the Activity defined in the
            [W3C Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-n/) on Provenance. Activity
            cannot be removed during a store operation by setting it to None. You must
            use: [synapseclient.models.Activity.delete_async][] or
            [synapseclient.models.Activity.disassociate_from_entity_async][].
        annotations: Additional metadata associated with the folder. The key is the name
            of your desired annotations. The value is an object containing a list of
            values (use empty list to represent no values for key) and the value type
            associated with all values in the list. To remove all annotations set this
            to an empty dict `{}` or None and store the entity.

    Attributes:
        content_type: (New Upload Only)
            Used to manually specify Content-type header, for example
            'application/png' or 'application/json; charset=UTF-8'. If not specified,
            the content type will be derived from the file extension.


            This can be specified only during the initial store of this file or any time
            there is a new file to upload.
            In order to change this after the File has been created use
            [synapseclient.models.File.change_metadata][].
        content_size: (New Upload Only)
            The size of the file in bytes. This can be specified only during the initial
            creation of the File. This is also only applicable to files not uploaded to
            Synapse. ie: `synapse_store` is False.

    Attributes:
        content_md5: (Store only) The MD5 of the file is known. If not supplied this
            will be computed in the client is possible. If supplied for a file entity
            already stored in Synapse it will be calculated again to check if a new
            upload needs to occur. This will not be filled in during a read for data. It
            is only used during a store operation. To retrieve the md5 of the file after
            read from synapse use the `.file_handle.content_md5` attribute.
        create_or_update: (Store only)
            Indicates whether the method should automatically perform an
            update if the `file` conflicts with an existing Synapse object.
        force_version: (Store only)
            Indicates whether the method should increment the version of the object if
            something within the entity has changed. For example updating the
            description or name. You may set this to False and an update to the
            entity will not increment the version.

            Updating the `version_label` attribute will also cause a version update
            regardless  of this flag.

            An update to the MD5 of the file will force a version update regardless of
            this  flag.
        is_restricted: (Store only)
            If set to true, an email will be sent to the Synapse access control
            team to start the process of adding terms-of-use or review board approval
            for this entity. You will be contacted with regards to the specific data
            being restricted and the requirements of access.

            This may be used only by an administrator of the specified file.
        merge_existing_annotations: (Store only)
            Works in conjunction with `create_or_update` in that this is only evaluated
            if `create_or_update` is True. If this entity exists in Synapse that has
            annotations that are not present in a store operation, these annotations
            will be added to the entity. If this is False any annotations that are not
            present within a store operation will be removed from this entity. This
            allows one to complete a destructive update of annotations on an entity.
        associate_activity_to_new_version: (Store only)
            Works in conjunction with `create_or_update` in that this is only evaluated
            if `create_or_update` is True. When true an activity already attached to the
            current version of this entity will be associated the new version during a
            store operation if the version was updated. This is useful if you are
            updating the entity and want to ensure that the activity is persisted onto
            the new version the entity.
        synapse_store: (Store only)
            Whether the File should be uploaded or if false: only the path should
            be stored when [synapseclient.models.File.store][] is called.

    Attributes:
        download_file: (Get only) If True the file will be downloaded.
        download_location: (Get only) The location to download the file to.
        if_collision: (Get only)
            Determines how to handle file collisions. Defaults to "keep.both". May be:

            - `overwrite.local`
            - `keep.local`
            - `keep.both`
        synapse_container_limit: (Get only)
            A Synanpse ID used to limit the search in Synapse if
            file is specified as a local file. That is, if the file is stored in
            multiple locations in Synapse only the ones in the specified folder/project
            will be returned.

    Attributes:
        etag: (Read Only) Synapse employs an Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC) scheme
            to handle concurrent updates. Since the E-Tag changes every time an entity
            is updated it is used to detect when a client's current representation of an
            entity is out-of-date.
        created_on: (Read Only) The date this entity was created.
        modified_on: (Read Only) The date this entity was last modified.

        modified_by: (Read Only) The ID of the user that last modified this entity.
        version_number: (Read Only) The version number issued to this version on the
            object.
        is_latest_version: (Read Only) If this is the latest version of the object.

        Store the file in Synapse. With this method you may:

        - Store a File object in Synapse without updating a file by setting
            `synapse_store` to False.
        - Change the name of a file in Synapse by setting the `name` attribute of the
            File object. Also see the [synapseclient.models.File.change_metadata][]
            method for changing the name of the downloaded file.
        - Moving a file to a new parent by setting the `parent_id` attribute of the
            File object.

        If no Name is specified this will be derived from the file name. This is the
        reccommended way to store a file in Synapse.

        Please note:
        The file, as it appears on disk, will be the file that is downloaded from
        Synapse. The name of the actual File is different from the name of the File
        Entity in Synapse. It is generally not reccommended to specify a different
        name for the Entity and the file as it will cause confusion and potential
        conflicts later on.

        Arguments:
            parent: The parent folder or project to store the file in. May also be
                specified in the File object. If both are provided the parent passed
                into `store` will take precedence.
            synapse_client: If not passed in or None this will use the last client from
                the `.login()` method.

        Returns:
            The file object.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If the file does not have an ID and a path, or a path and a
                parent ID, or a data file handle ID and a parent ID.
