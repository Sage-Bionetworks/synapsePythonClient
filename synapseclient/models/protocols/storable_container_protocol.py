        Sync this container and all possible sub-folders from Synapse. By default this
        will download the files that are found and it will populate the
        `files` and `folders` attributes with the found files and folders. If you only
        want to retrieve the full tree of metadata about your container specify
        `download_file` as False.

        This works similar to [synapseutils.syncFromSynapse][], however, this does not
        currently support the writing of data to a manifest TSV file. This will be a
        future enhancement.

        Only Files and Folders are supported at this time to be synced from synapse.

        Arguments:
            path: An optional path where the file hierarchy will be reproduced. If not
                specified the files will by default be placed in the synapseCache.
            recursive: Whether or not to recursively get the entire hierarchy of the
                folder and sub-folders.
            download_file: Whether to download the files found or not.
            if_collision: Determines how to handle file collisions. May be

                - `overwrite.local`
                - `keep.local`
                - `keep.both`
            failure_strategy: Determines how to handle failures when retrieving children
                under this Folder and an exception occurs.
            synapse_client: If not passed in or None this will use the last client from
                the `.login()` method.

        Returns:
            The object that was called on. This will be the same object that was called on
                to start the sync.

        Example: Using this function
            Suppose I want to walk the immediate children of a folder without downloading the files:

                from synapseclient import Synapse
                from synapseclient.models import Folder

                syn = Synapse()
                syn.login()

                my_folder = Folder(id="syn12345")
                my_folder.sync_from_synapse(download_file=False, recursive=False)

                for folder in my_folder.folders:
                    print(folder.name)

                for file in my_folder.files:
                    print(file.name)

            Suppose I want to download the immediate children of a folder:

                from synapseclient import Synapse
                from synapseclient.models import Folder

                syn = Synapse()
                syn.login()

                my_folder = Folder(id="syn12345")
                my_folder.sync_from_synapse(path="/path/to/folder", recursive=False)

                for folder in my_folder.folders:
                    print(folder.name)

                for file in my_folder.files:
                    print(file.name)


            Suppose I want to download the immediate all children of a Project and all sub-folders and files:

                from synapseclient import Synapse
                from synapseclient.models import Project

                syn = Synapse()
                syn.login()

                my_project = Project(id="syn12345")
                my_project.sync_from_synapse(path="/path/to/folder")


        Raises:
            ValueError: If the folder does not have an id set.
