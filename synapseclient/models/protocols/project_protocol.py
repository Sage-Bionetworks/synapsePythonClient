        Store project, files, and folders to synapse. If you have any files or folders
        attached to this project they will be stored as well. You may attach files

        By default the store operation will non-destructively update the project if
        you have not already retrieved the project from Synapse. If you have already
        retrieved the project from Synapse then the store operation will be destructive
        and will overwrite the project with the current state of this object. See the
        `create_or_update` attribute for more information.

        Arguments:
            failure_strategy: Determines how to handle failures when storing attached
                Files and Folders under this Project and an exception occurs.
