            schema_storage_strategy:
                (Default): SchemaStorageStrategy.INFER_FROM_DATA

                Determines how to automate the creation of columns
                based on the data that is being stored. If you want to have full
                control over the schema you may set this to `None` and create
                the columns manually.

                The limitation with this behavior is that the columns created may only
                be of the following types:

                - STRING
                - LARGETEXT
                - INTEGER
                - DOUBLE
                - BOOLEAN
                - DATE

                The determination is based on how this pandas function infers the
                data type: [infer_dtype](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.api.types.infer_dtype.html)

            column_expansion_strategy:
                (Default): ColumnExpansionStrategy.AUTO_EXPAND_CONTENT_AND_LIST_LENGTH

                Determines how to automate the expansion of
                columns based on the data that is being stored. The options given allow
                cells with a limit on the length of content (Such as strings) or cells
                with a limit on the number of values (Such as lists) to be expanded to
                a larger size if the data being stored exceeds the limit. If you want to
                have full control over the schema you may set this to `None` and create
                the columns manually.

        and locking the current version. After the snapshot is created a new version
        will be started with an 'in-progress' label.

        Arguments:
            comment: Comment to add to this snapshot to the table.
            label: Label to add to this snapshot to the table. The label must be unique,
                if a label is not provided a unique label will be generated.
            include_activity: If True the activity will be included in snapshot if it
                exists. In order to include the activity, the activity must have already
                been stored in Synapse by using the `activity` attribute on the Table

                activity to a snapshot of a table is meant to capture the provenance of

        Example: Creating a snapshot of a table
            Comment and label are optional, but filled in for this example.

                from synapseclient.models import Table
                from synapseclient import Synapse

                syn = Synapse()
                syn.login()

                my_table = Table(id="syn1234")
                my_table.snapshot(
                    comment="This is a new snapshot comment",
                    label="This is a unique label"
                )

        Example: Including the activity (Provenance) in the snapshot and not pulling it forward to the new `in-progress` version of the table.
            By default this method is set up to include the activity in the snapshot and
            then pull the activity forward to the new version. If you do not want to
            include the activity in the snapshot you can set `include_activity` to
            False. If you do not want to pull the activity forward to the new version
            you can set `associate_activity_to_new_version` to False.

            See the [activity][synapseclient.models.Activity] attribute on the Table
            class for more information on how to interact with the activity.
