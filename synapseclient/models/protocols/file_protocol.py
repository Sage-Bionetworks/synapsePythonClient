        Store the file in Synapse. With this method you may:

        - Upload a file into Synapse
        - Update the metadata of a file in Synapse
        - Store a File object in Synapse without updating a file by setting
            `synapse_store` to False.
        - Change the name of a file in Synapse by setting the `name` attribute of the
            File object. Also see the [synapseclient.models.File.change_metadata][]
            method for changing the name of the downloaded file.
        - Moving a file to a new parent by setting the `parent_id` attribute of the
            File object.

        Arguments:
            parent: The parent folder or project to store the file in. May also be
                specified in the File object. If both are provided the parent passed
                into `store` will take precedence.
            synapse_client: If not passed in or None this will use the last client from
                the `.login()` method.

        Returns:
            The file object.


        Example: Using this function
            File with the ID `syn123` at path `path/to/file.txt`:
