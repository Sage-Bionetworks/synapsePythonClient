        benefactor is the entity that the current entity inherits its permissions from.
        The benefactor is usually the parent entity, but it can be any ancestor in the

        Delete the entire Access Control List (ACL) for a given Entity. This is not
        scoped to a specific user or group, but rather removes all permissions
        associated with the Entity. After this operation, the Entity will inherit
        permissions from its benefactor, which is typically its parent entity or
        the Project it belongs to.

        In order to remove permissions for a specific user or group, you
        should use the `set_permissions` method with the `access_type` set to
        an empty list.

        By default, Entities such as FileEntity and Folder inherit their permission from
        their containing Project. For such Entities the Project is the Entity's 'benefactor'.
        This permission inheritance can be overridden by creating an ACL for the Entity.
        When this occurs the Entity becomes its own benefactor and all permission are
        determined by its own ACL.

        If the ACL of an Entity is deleted, then its benefactor will automatically be set
        to its parent's benefactor.

        **Special notice for Projects:** The ACL for a Project cannot be deleted, you
        must individually update or revoke the permissions for each user or group.

        Arguments:
            include_self: If True (default), delete the ACL of the current entity.
                If False, skip deleting the ACL of the current entity.
            include_container_content: If True, delete ACLs from contents directly within
                containers (files and folders inside self). This must be set to
                True for recursive to have any effect. Defaults to False.
            recursive: If True and the entity is a container (e.g., Project or Folder),
                recursively process child containers. Note that this must be used with
                include_container_content=True to have any effect. Setting recursive=True
                with include_container_content=False will raise a ValueError.
                Only works on classes that support the `sync_from_synapse_async` method.
            target_entity_types: Specify which entity types to process when deleting ACLs.
                Allowed values are "folder" and "file" (case-insensitive).
                If None, defaults to ["folder", "file"]. This does not affect the
                entity type of the current entity, which is always processed if
                `include_self=True`.
            dry_run: If True, log the changes that would be made instead of actually
                performing the deletions. When enabled, all ACL deletion operations are
                simulated and logged at info level. Defaults to False.
            show_acl_details: When dry_run=True, controls whether current ACL details are
                displayed for entities that will have their permissions changed. If True (default),
                shows detailed ACL information. If False, hides ACL details for cleaner output.
                Has no effect when dry_run=False.
            show_files_in_containers: When dry_run=True, controls whether files within containers
                are displayed in the preview. If True (default), shows all files. If False, hides
                files when their only change is benefactor inheritance (but still shows files with
                local ACLs being deleted). Has no effect when dry_run=False.
            benefactor_tracker: Optional tracker for managing benefactor relationships.
                Used for recursive functionality to track which entities will be affected
