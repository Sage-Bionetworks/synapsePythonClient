# Defines a mechanism for printing file transfer progress that includes potentially multiple file transfers to the
# console in a possibly multi threaded manner. Normally each individual file download will write its own output
# to the console, overwriting each other if multiple file downloads are concurrently running.
# This will print a running total of transferred bytes with each finished file printed as it is completed.

# we use a thread local to configure this because we are potentially running file transfers in multiple threads,
# and we don't want individual download implementations to have to know about the details or track
# any other concurrent downloads. instead it is up to a master coordinator that is launching the threads (e.g.
# a Synapse sync) to configure the thread state. individual download implementations don't have to do anything
# but import and use this instead of the underlying utils function.
