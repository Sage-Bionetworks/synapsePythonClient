Reference:
The purpose of the documents in this folder is to focus on the interfaces input and output
when working with the client. Documents here are meant to be consulted with to solve
a problem.

Guideline:
- Be consistent
- Provide brief to-the-point examples
- Describe what something does and link to tutorials/how-to guides/explanations if needed
- Be complete, if you give an example provide the preconditions



X is an example of y. W needs to be initialised using z. This option does that.
    State facts about the machinery and its behaviour.

Sub-commands are: a, b, c, d, e, f.
    List commands, options, operations, features, flags, limitations, error messages, etc.

You must use a. You must not apply b unless c. Never d.
    Provide warnings where appropriate.
