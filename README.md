Python Synapse Client
=====================

A python client for [Sage Synapse](https://synapse.sagebase.org/), a collaborative compute space that allows scientists to share and analyze data together. Please visit the [Getting Started Guide to Synapse](https://sagebionetworks.jira.com/wiki/x/R4B3AQ) page for more information.

The Python client can be used as a library for development of software that communicates with Synapse or as a command-line utility. See also the [Synapse R client](https://sagebionetworks.jira.com/wiki/display/SYNR/Home).


Installation
------------

The python synapse client has been tested on python 2.7.

### Install using pip

The [Python Synapse Client is on PyPI](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/SynapseClient) and can be installed with pip:

    pip install synapseclient

### Install from source

Clone the [source code repository](https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/synapsePythonClient).

    git clone git://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/synapsePythonClient.git
    cd synapsePythonClient
    python setup.py install


Command line usage
------------------

The synapse client can be used from the shell command prompt. Valid commands
include: query, get, cat, add, update, delete, and onweb. A few examples are
shown.

### querying for entities that are part of the [Synapse Commons Repository](https://synapse.sagebase.org/Portal.html#Synapse:syn150935)

    synapse -u me@nowhere.com -p secret query 'select id, name from entity where parentId=="syn150935"'

### querying for a test [entity](https://synapse.sagebase.org/Portal.html#Synapse:syn1528299)
The test entity is tagged with an attribute *test_data* whose value is "bogus". We'll use the ID
of this entity in the next example.

    synapse -u me@nowhere.com -p secret query 'select id, name, parentId from entity where test_data=="bogus"'

### downloading test data from synapse

    synapse -u me@nowhere.com -p secret get syn1528299

### getting help

    synapse -h

Note that a [synapse account](https://synapse.sagebase.org/#RegisterAccount:0) is required.


Usage as a library
------------------

The synapse client can be used to write software that interacts with the Sage Synapse repository.

### Example

    import synapseclient

    s = synapseclient.Synapse()
    s.login('me@nowhere.com', 'secret')

    e = s.getEntity('syn1528299')

    print(e['name'])
    print(e['description'])
    print(e['files'])

    ## assuming the file is a short text file, read it as a list of lines
    with open(e['files'][0]) as f:
  		lines = f.readlines()


Authentication
--------------
Authentication toward [synapse](https://synapse.sagebase.org/#RegisterAccount:0) can be specified in three ways:

1. By passing username and password to the login function (or using the -u and -p parameters on the command line)

2. Creating a configuration file in the home directory called .synapseConfig that contains the username and password. See example below.

3. Using cached authentication. Everytime the client authenticates the credentials are cached for 24 hours.  Meaning that subsequent interactions do not need the username and password credentials.


###Example config file stored in ~/.synapseConfig
    [authentication]
    username: me@nowhere.com
    password: secret
