    The format of the manifest file is a tab delimited file with one row per file to upload and columns describing the

    Synapse Id of the project or folder where the file is uploaded to. In addition to these columns you can specify any
    of the parameters to the File constructor (**name**, **synapseStore**, **contentType**) as well as parameters to the
    syn.store command (**used**, **executed**, **activityName**, **activityDescription**, **forceVersion**).  For only
    updating annotations without uploading new versions of unchanged files, the syn.store parameter forceVersion
    should be included in the manifest with the value set to False.
    Used and executed can be semi-colon (";") separated lists of Synapse ids, urls and/or local filepaths of files
    already stored in Synapse (or being stored in Synapse by the manifest).  If you leave a space, like
    "syn1234; syn2345" the white space from " syn2345" will be stripped.
    Any additional columns will be added as annotations.

    **Required fields:**

    **Provenance fields:**

    Each of these are individual examples and is what you would find in a row in each of these columns. To
    clarify, "syn1235;/path/to_local/file.txt" below states that you would like both
    "syn1234" and "/path/to_local/file.txt" added as items used to generate a file. You can also specify one item
    by specifying "syn1234"

    ====================   =====================================  ============================================

    **Annotations:**

    Any columns that are not in the reserved names described above will be interpreted as annotations of the file
