# Rest APIs

This section is for super users / developers only.
These functions are subject to change as they are internal development
functions. Use at your own risk.


The functions provided in these documents are generally direct representations of the
Synapse REST API. They're used within the Synapse Python Client to interact with the
Synapse servers. These will eventually be removed from the Synapse Python Client in
favor of an auto-generated client derived from the
[Synapse Open API Spec](https://rest-docs.synapse.org/rest/openapi/openapispecification.json).
