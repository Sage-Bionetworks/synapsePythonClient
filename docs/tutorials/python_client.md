# Working with the Python client

Welcome to the Synapse Python client! In the following tutorials you'll create a
new project and learn about things you can do with that project.

These examples are themed around a biomedical researcher working with Alzheimer's
Disease wanting to share their findings with their colleagues, and the world.

## Prerequisites

To get started with these tutorials make sure that you have completed the
[Installation](./installation.md) and [Authentication](./authentication.md) setup.


## End goal
By the end of these tutorials you'll have:

- A [Project](./python/project.md) created in Synapse
- [Folders](./python/folder.md) and [Files](./python/file.md) added to your project
- [Annotations](./python/annotation.md) added to your Project, Folders, and Files
- A File with multiple [Versions](./python/versions.md)
- A File that has an [Activity/Provenance](./python/activity.md) added to it
- A [Entity View/File View](./python/entityview.md) created for your Project
- A [Table](./python/table.md) created for your Project
- [Create, Read, Update, Delete operations](./python/table_crud.md) for your table
- A [Dataset](./python/dataset.md) created for your project
- A File with updated [sharing settings](./python/sharing_settings.md)
- A [Wiki](./python/wiki.md) for your Project
- A [Team](./python/team.md) created with one or more members
- Methods to [upload data in bulk](./python/upload_data_in_bulk.md)
- Methods to [download data in bulk](./python/download_data_in_bulk.md)
- Methods to [move files and folders](./python/move_files_and_folders.md)
- Methods to [migrate data to other storage locations](./python/migrate_data_to_other_storage_locations.md)
