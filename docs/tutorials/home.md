# Getting Started
Welcome!

In this module you'll find everything you need to get you and your team sharing,
organizing, and discussing your scientific research.


## What do you need to get started?
First off, to browse Synapse and access its most basic level of functionality, you
will need to [register for a Synapse account](https://www.synapse.org/RegisterAccount:0).
In doing so, you will be agreeing to the
[Synapse Code of Conduct and Synapse Terms and Conditions of Use](https://help.synapse.org/docs/Synapse-Governance.2004255211.html).

If you’re simply looking to view a public wiki page, or browse our public project or
file catalog, you can do so without registering for a Synapse account.

To perform other functions within Synapse, such as exploring, downloading, uploading,
and organizing data, there are additional steps to take:


## Exploring and downloading data

As a
[registered user](https://help.synapse.org/docs/Synapse-User-Account-Types.2007072795.html#SynapseUserAccountTypes-RegisteredUser),
you can view and download any data that is publicly available.

However, some data is considered controlled access and requires additional protections
for who can access it and how it can be used. This data will be clearly labelled with
its specific
[conditions for use](https://help.synapse.org/docs/Sharing-Settings,-Permissions,-and-Conditions-for-Use.2024276030.html).
Occasionally, access to controlled data requires additional steps, like having your
analysis plan approved by an ethics board or IRB. Controlled access data can not be
shared. Anyone wishing to gain access to said data must individually agree to the
conditions for use.


## Uploading, organizing, and curating data

To work with data of your own or your team’s, you must become a
[certified user](https://help.synapse.org/docs/Synapse-User-Account-Types.2007072795.html#SynapseUserAccountTypes-CertifiedUser). To become certified, you must pass a
[certification quiz](https://www.synapse.org/Quiz:Certification),
 which will ask you about information that can be found throughout this documentation site.


## Accessing mHealth data

To access mHealth data, you must become a
[validated user](https://help.synapse.org/docs/Synapse-User-Account-Types.2007072795.html#SynapseUserAccountTypes-ValidatedUsers).

## Debugging in the client
Erorrs happen, and when they do it is useful to turn on debug level logging within the
Synapse client. In order to turn on debug level logging see:

- [Debug flag for the programmatic interface](../reference/client.md?h=debug#synapseclient.Synapse)
- [Debug flag for the command line interface](./command_line_client.md?h=debug#options)
