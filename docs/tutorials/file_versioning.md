# File Upload

Files in Synapse are versionable. Please see [Versioning](https://help.synapse.org/docs/Versioning.2668134540.html) for more information about how versions in Files works.

## Uploading a New Version

Uploading a new version follows the same steps as uploading a file for the first time - use the same file name and store it in the same location (e.g., the same parentId). It is recommended to add a comment to the new version in order to easily track differences at a glance. The example file `raw_data.txt` will now have a version of 2 and a comment describing the change.

Explicit example:

```python
import synapseclient

# fetch the file in Synapse
file_to_update = syn.get('syn2222', downloadFile=False)

# save the local path to the new version of the file
file_to_update.path = '/path/to/new/version/of/raw_data.txt'

# add a version comment
file_to_update.versionComment = 'Added 5 random normally distributed numbers.'

# store the new file
updated_file = syn.store(file_to_update)
```

Implicit example:

```python
# Assuming that there is a file created with:
syn.store(File('path/to/old/raw_data.txt', parentId='syn123456'))

# To create a new version of that file, make sure you store it with the exact same name
new_file = syn.store(File('path/to/new_version/raw_data.txt',  parentId='syn123456'))
```

## Updating Annotations or Provenance without Changing Versions

Any change to a File will automatically update its version. If this isnâ€™t the desired behavior, such as minor changes to the metadata, you can set `forceVersion=False` with the Python client. For command line, the commands `set-annotations` and `set-provenance` will update the metadata without creating a new version. Adding/updating annotations and provenance in the web client will also not cause a version change.

**Important: Because Provenance is tracked by version, set `forceVersion=False` for minor changes to avoid breaking Provenance.**

Setting annotations without changing version:

```python
# Get file from Synapse, set download=False since we are only updating annotations
file = syn.get('syn56789', download=False)

# Add annotations
file.annotations = {"fileType":"bam", "assay":"RNA-seq"}

# Store the file without creating a new version
file = syn.store(file, forceVersion=False)
```

## Setting Provenance without Changing Version

To set Provenance without changing the file version:

```python
# Get file from Synapse, set download=False since we are only updating provenance
file = syn.get('syn56789', download=False)

# Add provenance
file = syn.setProvenance(file, activity = Activity(used = '/path/to/example_code'))

# Store the file without creating a new version
file = syn.store(file, forceVersion=False)
```

## Downloading a Specific Version

By default, the File downloaded will always be the most recent version. However, a specific version can be downloaded by passing the version parameter:

```python
entity = syn.get("syn3260973", version=1)
```
