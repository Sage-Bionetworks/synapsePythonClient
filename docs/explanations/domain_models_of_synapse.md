# Domain Model of Synapse
Here you'll find more information about how all of the models/concepts of Synapse
work together and what their purpose is.

## Projects
Projects in Synapse are “containers” that group relevant content and people together. All data must be uploaded into a project. Projects can be private so only you can see the contents, they can be shared with your collaborators, or they can be made public so anyone on the web can view your research.

Projects help you to:

* **Organize your work**: With Synapse, you can organize the parts in your workflow (data, code, etc) into a hierarchy like a file system. With the tabs across the top of each project, you can easily navigate to your wikis, files and folders, SQL-based tables, and even conduct conversations using discussion forums.

* **Store data, code, and results**: You can upload your data, code, and results to Synapse, or store a reference to their location in your local computer system or on the web. Everything can be stored as files hosted by Synapse, in your own external cloud storage, or using Docker containers.

* **Control data access or release it publicly**: You have complete control over how users and groups can interact with your work. Work privately, openly, or somewhere in between.

* **Link and share content with others**: Just as you can control the access to your work, projects can serve as a platform for linking and sharing your work with others.

* **Custom, searchable annotations**: Assign any key/value pair you want. Those values become searchable and available to those granted access.

* **Attach figures and documents**: Upload documents and images via the website or programmatically.
